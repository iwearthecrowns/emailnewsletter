Project 1 work
Trying to use the terminal from VSCode
I have opened the terminal. There is something about a staging area
Okay, so this is on the local repo
ack
Lines 3 and on is work from July 4
there is something that i'm missing
Is it because I have to save?...
So the terminal noticed some changes...
How do I stage something?
Holy shit- I did it

Steps:
Save code (CTRL-S in the coding workspace)
git commit -m "what did you do in the current version"
-- saves to local repo (directory)
files in red- changes, not stages
git add, [space], first letter of file name, [TAB]- autofills name
git status
files in green- staged, and ready to commit
git push origin master- sends saved files to repo

making a change in the github to pull to local repo...
