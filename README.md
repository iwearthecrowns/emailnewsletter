Project 1 work: Cathy Cheo-Isaacs, Melissa McMahon, & Almarose Revives at MCCS3 in USA
Trying to use the terminal from VSCode
I have opened the terminal. There is something about a staging area
Okay, so this is on the local repo
ack
Lines 3 and on is work from July 4
there is something that i'm missing
Is it because I have to save?...
So the terminal noticed some changes...
How do I stage something?
Holy shit- I did it

STEPS:
1- Save code (CTRL-S in the coding workspace)
2- git add, [space], first letter of file name, [TAB]-> autofills filename
3- git commit -m "what did you do in the current version"
--> saves to local repo (directory)
4- git status
files in green- staged, and ready to commit
files in red- changes exist, but have not been staged (need to add)
5- git push origin master- sends saved files to repo

If you want to double check that it worked- go to the shared repo in github, refresh to check if file was uploaded


LIVESHARE
1- Start LiveShare session
2- Invite collaborators
3- Allow terminal to be read-write
